# Navbar Component Structure

## 📁 File Organization

The navbar has been split into smaller, reusable components for better maintainability and readability:

### Components:

- **`Logo.jsx`** - Company logo and branding
- **`SearchBar.jsx`** - Search functionality with expand/collapse
- **`ActionIcons.jsx`** - Wishlist, Cart, and User action buttons
- **`NavigationItems.jsx`** - Main navigation links with dropdown support
- **`AuthButtons.jsx`** - Authentication buttons (Sign In/Sign Up/Logout)
- **`UserDropdown.jsx`** - User dropdown menu with profile options
- **`MobileMenu.jsx`** - Mobile-specific menu layout
- **`MobileMenuButton.jsx`** - Hamburger menu toggle button
- **`Navbar.jsx`** - Main component that orchestrates all parts

### Configuration:

- **`constants.js`** - Navigation data, categories, and mock data
- **`index.js`** - Export file for clean imports

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Modularity**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Components can be reused in other parts of the app
3. **Maintainability**: Easy to find and update specific functionality
4. **Testability**: Each component can be tested individually
5. **Readability**: Smaller files are easier to understand
6. **Performance**: Better tree-shaking and code splitting

## 📊 Before vs After

**Before:**

- 1 file (~580 lines)
- All logic in one place
- Hard to maintain

**After:**

- 11 files (~50-100 lines each)
- Separated concerns
- Easy to maintain and extend

## 🔧 Usage

The main `Navbar.jsx` file imports and orchestrates all components. The old `Navbar.jsx` now simply re-exports the new modular version, maintaining backward compatibility.

```jsx
// All components are imported and used in Navbar.jsx
import { Logo, SearchBar, ActionIcons /* ... */ } from "./index";
```
